# (âˆ†, Theta)-Free Graph Recognition

This repository implements a recognition algorithm to determine whether an input graph is free of both triangles (Kâ‚ƒ) and theta subgraphs.

The implementation is based on the "three-in-a-tree" framework, adapted for use with pruned subgraphs from the neighbourhood of a node. This forms part of a final-year dissertation in Computer Science.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- NetworkX library (for graph operations)

# How to Run

python main.py

Each graph will be tested and labelled either as:
- (âˆ†, theta)-free
- Not (âˆ†, theta)-free

# Project Structure

recognition/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Loads graphs and executes the recognition check
â”œâ”€â”€ recognition.py          # Triangle check and theta-finding logic
â”œâ”€â”€ three_in_a_tree.py      # Modified algorithm for induced tree detection
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â””â”€â”€ evaluation_test_graphs.json  # Input graphs 

# Notes

- Input graphs must be undirected and in JSON adjacency list format.
