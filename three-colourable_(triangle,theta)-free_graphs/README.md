# Colouring Algorithm for (âˆ†, Theta)-Free Graphs

This repository implements a decomposition-based 3-colouring algorithm for graphs that are free of both triangles (Kâ‚ƒ) and theta subgraphs. It applies recursive clique cutset decomposition to reduce graphs into colourable components and merges the results into a global colouring.

This tool was developed as part of a final-year Computer Science dissertation.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- NetworkX (for graph utilities)

# How to run

python main.py

This will:
- Load graphs from data/sample_graphs.json
- For each graph:
    - Check if it is bipartite,
    - If not, apply clique cutset decomposition and 3-colour the components,
    - Print and log the final colouring or rejection if the graph is not (âˆ†, theta)-free.

Output is saved to decomposition_output.log
